# Report on Multivariate Gaussian Distribution Analysis

## Objective

The primary objective of the provided code is to analyze and visualize data generated from two multivariate Gaussian distributions. The code calculates the necessary statistical parameters (mean and covariance) for a given training dataset, evaluates the probability of test data points under the learned distribution, and compares these probabilities against a second predefined distribution. Additionally, the code generates random data samples from both distributions and visualizes the results.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several sections:

1. **Data Definition**: The means and covariance matrices for two Gaussian distributions are defined.
2. **Computational Functions**: Functions are created to calculate the mean, covariance, probability density, and error metrics.
3. **Training and Test Data**: A training dataset is specified, alongside a set of test data points.
4. **Parameter Calculation**: The code computes the mean and covariance of the training data.
5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability of each test data point under the training distribution is evaluated.
6. **Error Evaluation**: The mean squared error (MSE) is calculated by comparing predicted values (set as the training mean) against the actual test values.
7. **Secondary Dataset Utilization**: The code calculates probabilities for the test data points under the second distribution.
8. **Data Generation**: New random samples are generated from both Gaussian distributions.
9. **Data Visualization**: The generated samples and their corresponding means are plotted.

## Results and Analysis

### Statistical Parameters

- The mean and covariance of the training dataset are calculated, providing insights into the central tendency and dispersion of the data. For instance, if the mean vector is `[1.2, 2.1]` and the covariance matrix reflects the spread of the points, these parameters define the characteristics of the fitted Gaussian distribution.

### Probability Evaluation

- The code computes the probability density of each test data point given the learned model parameters. This step assesses how likely each test point is under the training distribution. Higher probabilities indicate that the test points are more likely to belong to the training data distribution.

### Error Calculation

- The mean squared error (MSE) is computed to evaluate the accuracy of predictions. The predicted values are set as the training mean, and the actual test data points are compared against these predictions. A lower MSE indicates better predictive performance, reflecting how closely the predicted mean represents the actual test data.

### Secondary Distribution Analysis

- The code also evaluates the probability of the test data points under the second Gaussian distribution. This allows for a comparison of how well the test data fits both distributions, which can be particularly useful in applications such as classification or anomaly detection.

### Data Generation and Visualization

- The code generates 100 new samples from each of the two defined distributions, allowing for a better understanding of the data's distribution. The generated data is then visualized using scatter plots, which display how the samples from each distribution cluster around their respective means. This visualization aids in understanding the shape and spread of the underlying Gaussian distributions.

## Conclusion

The code effectively demonstrates the analysis of multivariate Gaussian distributions through statistical calculations and data visualization. By calculating key parameters such as mean and covariance, evaluating probabilities, and assessing predictive performance via MSE, the code offers valuable insights into the characteristics of the distributions involved. The visualizations further enhance comprehension by providing a clear representation of the data and its distribution properties. Overall, this analysis could be applied in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and data science, where understanding distributions is crucial for model development and evaluation.
